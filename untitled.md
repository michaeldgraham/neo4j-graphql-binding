# Introduction

This project is an attempt to explore and integrate current resources for using GraphQL with Neo4j graph databases. It seems that GraphQL users could benefit from using graph databases and graph database users could benefit from using GraphQL. Thankfully, much has already been done to support this direction.

As part of the [GRANDstack](https://grandstack.io/) project, Neo4j has developed an extension named [Neo4j-GraphQL](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql), which exposes an auto-generated GraphQL API and custom procedures for updating the schema and running operations.   
  
Neo4j has also developed the [neo4j-graphql-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-js) package, which converts GraphQL requests to Cypher requests in order to support using GraphQL and Neo4j together without requiring the use of the Neo4j-GraphQL extension.  
  
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) has developed a variety of [GraphQL resources](https://oss.prisma.io), including the [graphql-binding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-binding) package, which provides a way to embed a remote GraphQL API within your own server.

### Benefits

* Augments your schema without needing to introspect your Neo4j-GraphQL HTTP endpoint and uses the âš¡ Bolt driver for all operations.
* Allows using the `@cypher` directive from `Neo4j-GraphQL` on both query and mutation types by 
* Generates the same query types and arguments generated by `Neo4j-GraphQL`. This currently includes `first`, `offset`, `orderBy,` and `filter`.
* Generates `resolvers` for auto-generated or `@cypher` directive query and mutation types.
* Supports nested `create` and `connect` mutations similar to those in the [Prisma Mutation API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/prisma-api/mutations-ol0yuoz6go) \(update, delete, etc. in development\).
* Supports a `@unique` field directive, adds `id` field if not provided, and generates `id` field values using `cuid` for all auto-generated `create` mutations.

### Goals

Progressive enhancement / getting thinner as neo4j-graphql evolves / end goal of just being a proxy layer with minimal sprinkles
