# Introduction

This project is an attempt to explore and integrate current resources for using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph databases. It seems that GraphQL users could benefit from using graph databases and graph database users could benefit from using GraphQL. Thankfully, much has already been done to support this direction.

As part of the [GRANDstack](https://grandstack.io/) project, Neo4j has built an extension named [Neo4j-GraphQL](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql), which exposes auto-generated [query](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql#auto-generated-query-types) and [mutation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/prisma-api/mutations-ol0yuoz6go#nested-mutations) types and custom procedures for updating the schema and running operations. They have also developed the [neo4j-graphql-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-js) package, which converts GraphQL requests directly to Cypher requests.   
  
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) has developed a variety of [GraphQL resources](https://oss.prisma.io), including the [graphql-binding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-binding) package, which provides a way to embed a remote GraphQL API within your own server. Many features of this package have been drawn from the [Prisma API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/prisma-api/overview-ohm2ouceuj), most notably their support for [nested mutations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/prisma-api/mutations-ol0yuoz6go#nested-mutations).  


TODO BEGIN  
  
Goal is to draw from neo4j-graphql and prisma to...   
  
Apollo Link... Server...   
  
Explain that for query types I just pass them off to neo4j-graphql, and for mutations, I provide custom support, for now, converting the GraphQL request into a complex Cypher statement \(such as with nested mutations, etc.\)

Endgame: Progressive enhancement / getting thinner as neo4j-graphql evolves / end goal of just being a proxy layer with minimal sprinkles  
  
TODO END

### Benefits

* Augments your schema without needing to introspect your Neo4j-GraphQL HTTP endpoint and uses the âš¡ Bolt driver for all operations. 
* Allows using the [@cypher](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql#directives) directive from `Neo4j-GraphQL` for custom query and mutation operations and computed fields. 
* Generates the same [query types](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/graphql-api/query-api-nia9nushae#query-arguments) generated by `Neo4j-GraphQL`, as well as the _query arguments_ `first`, `offset`, `orderBy,` and `filter` \(see: [Prisma Query API](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/graphql-api/query-api-nia9nushae#query-arguments)\). 
* Supports nested [create and connect](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/prisma-api/mutations-ol0yuoz6go/#examples) mutations like those in the Prisma Mutation API \(update, delete, etc. in development\). 
* Generates `resolvers` for query and mutation types with a `@cypher` directive, as well as all auto-generated types. 
* Supports a [@unique](https://www.prisma.io/docs/1.4/reference/service-configuration/data-modelling-%28sdl%29-eiroozae8u/#field-constraints) field directive for node property constraints in Neo4j in order to make node selection in auto-generate mutations more robust.  
* Adds a [id: ID! @unique](https://www.prisma.io/docs/1.4/reference/service-configuration/data-modelling-%28sdl%29-eiroozae8u/#system-fields) field \(if not provided\) to any type with a `@model` directive and uses the [cuid ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cuid)package to generate id field values for all auto-generated creation mutations.
