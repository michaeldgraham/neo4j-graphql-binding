# Introduction

### Purpose

This project is an attempt to explore and integrate current resources for using GraphQL with Neo4j graph databases. It seems that GraphQL users could benefit from using graph databases and graph database users could benefit from using GraphQL. Thankfully, much has already been done in this direction. 

As part of the [GRANDstack](https://grandstack.io/) project, Neo4j has developed an extension named [Neo4j-GraphQL](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql), which exposes an auto-generated GraphQL API and custom procedures for updating the schema and running operations. They have also developed the `neo4j-graphql-js`package, which converts GraphQL requests to Cypher requests.  
  
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) has developed the`graphql-binding` package, which provides a way to embed a remote GraphQL API within your own server.  
  
The current strategy of `neo4j-graphql-binding` is to create a custom GraphQL binding over the schema created by `makeRemoteExecutableSchema`from `graphql-tools` , using your local `typeDefs`and a custom Apollo Link.   
  
When you send a GraphQL request to a resolver that delegates to the binding, the link receives the operation, processes it to support various features, and finally uses the Bolt driver to send the operation to your Neo4j-GraphQL endpoint as a Cypher query that calls a custom procedure provided by the Neo4j-GraphQL extension \(`graphql.query` for queries and `graphql.execute`for mutations\).

### Benefits

* Supports using the `@cypher` directive from `Neo4j-GraphQL` on both query and mutation types. 
* Uses the same query types and arguments \(first, offset, orderBy, filter\) generated by `Neo4j-GraphQL`. 
* Generates `resolvers` for auto-generated or `@cypher` directive query and mutation types. 
* Supports nested `create` and `connect` mutations similar to those in the Prisma Mutation API \(update, delete, etc. in development\). 
* Supports a `@unique` field directive, adds `id` field if not provided, and generates `id` field values using `cuid` for all auto-generated `create` mutations.
