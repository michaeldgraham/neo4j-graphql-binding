# Introduction

It seems that [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) users could benefit from using __graph databases and graph database users could benefit from using GraphQL. Thankfully, much has already been done to support this direction.  
  
The goal of this project is to explore that direction further by attempting to integrate methods and resources developed by [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

As part of the [GRANDstack](https://grandstack.io/) project, Neo4j has built a GraphQL-Endpoint extension named [Neo4j-GraphQL](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql), which provides an [auto-generated API](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql#auto-generated-query-types) and custom database procedures for updating the schema and running operations. They have also developed the [neo4j-graphql-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-js) package, which converts GraphQL requests directly to Cypher requests and so does not need to depend upon the use of the Neo4j-GraphQL extension.

Apollo...  
  
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) has developed a variety of [GraphQL resources](https://oss.prisma.io). Their [graphql-binding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-binding) package makes it easier to use  [schema delegation](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-schema-delegation-9d832648c543) to pass requests made to your local GraphQL server over to a remote GraphQL API. Many features of this package have been drawn from the [Prisma API](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/prisma-api/overview-ohm2ouceuj), most notably their support for [nested mutations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/prisma-api/mutations-ol0yuoz6go#nested-mutations).

TODO BEGIN  
  
Goal is to built an api that first draws from neo4j-graphql and prisma to...   
a hope is that as the Neo4j-GraphQL plugin evolves, this package will become thinner,   
secondly, once that is developed, i want to explore some of what may be possibly with a GraphQL integration with a Neo4j graph database, such as taking advantage of properties on relations.   
  
  
Explain that for query types I just pass them off to neo4j-graphql, and for mutations, I provide custom support, for now, converting the GraphQL request into a complex Cypher statement \(such as with nested mutations, etc.\)

Endgame: Progressive enhancement / getting thinner as neo4j-graphql evolves / end goal of just being a proxy layer with minimal sprinkles  
  
TODO END

### Features

* Augments your schema without needing to introspect your Neo4j-GraphQL HTTP endpoint and uses the âš¡ Bolt driver for all operations. 
* Allows using the [@cypher](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql#directives) directive from `Neo4j-GraphQL` for computed fields, query types and mutations. 
* Generates the same [query types](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/graphql-api/query-api-nia9nushae#query-arguments) generated by `Neo4j-GraphQL`, as well as the _query arguments_ `first`, `offset`, `orderBy,` and `filter` \(see: [Prisma Query API](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/graphql-api/query-api-nia9nushae#query-arguments)\). 
* Supports nested [create and connect](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/prisma-api/mutations-ol0yuoz6go/#examples) mutations like those in the Prisma Mutation API \(update, delete, etc. in development\). 
* Generates `resolvers` for query and mutation types with a `@cypher` directive, as well as all auto-generated types. 
* Supports a [@unique](https://www.prisma.io/docs/1.4/reference/service-configuration/data-modelling-%28sdl%29-eiroozae8u/#field-constraints) field directive for node property constraints in Neo4j in order to make node selection in auto-generate mutations more robust.  
* Adds a [id: ID! @unique](https://www.prisma.io/docs/1.4/reference/service-configuration/data-modelling-%28sdl%29-eiroozae8u/#system-fields) field \(if not provided\) to any type with a `@model` directive and uses the [cuid ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cuid)package to generate id field values for all auto-generated creation mutations.
